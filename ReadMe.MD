> [!NOTE]
> These are ripped using FModel QA build. The original PSK/X are uploaded as well as a converted FBX model when possible. All models that have morphs will have morphs in both formats (psk/x and fbx).

> [!WARNING]
> FBX models were processed as minimally as possible in blender but were scaled down by 0.01 from the original scale of the PSK/X model. The head bone was straightened and the rolls were reset to make VRChat model creation simpler. NONE OF THE MORPHS WERE CHANGED AND NONE WERE ADDED. SOME MODELS HAVE UNUSED/EMPTY MORPHS, ITS UP TO YOU TO DO THE ACTUAL WORK.
