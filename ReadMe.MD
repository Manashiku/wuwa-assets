> [!NOTE]
> These are ripped using FModel QA build. The original uemodel files are uploaded as well as a converted FBX model when possible. All models that have morphs will have morphs in both formats (.uemodel and .fbx).
> If you want to open the uemodel's on your own, you can load them using the blender plugin in from https://github.com/halfuwu/UEFormat

> [!WARNING]
> FBX models were processed as minimally as possible in blender. The head bone was straightened and the rolls were reset to make VRChat model creation simpler. NONE OF THE MORPHS WERE CHANGED AND NONE WERE ADDED. SOME MODELS HAVE UNUSED/EMPTY MORPHS, ITS UP TO YOU TO DO THE ACTUAL WORK.
